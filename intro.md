Introduction to Deirenism

Deirenism is a rationalistic natural religion based on reason and science rather than revelation and supernaturalism. By embracing humanism and religious pluralism, Deirenism seeks to unite religious and irreligious people of different backgrounds towards the common goal of securing a bright future for humanity. The widespread cooperation between diverse groups of people envisioned by Deirenism requires mutual respect and acceptance but also mutual protection from harm. Based on the understanding that the definition of harm can depend on cultural, religious, and secular context, Deirenic ideals include both freedom of religion and freedom from religion.

Describing itself as a consistent axiomatic system of beliefs, Deirenism claims that its beliefs do not contradict each other. Furthermore, Deirenic beliefs are said to be compatible with common sense, empirical observations, scientific knowledge, and historical facts. This internal consistency and harmony with the natural world helps Deirenists avoid the cognitive dissonance that occurs when people try to believe things that they know, albeit subconsciously, are irrational or simply not true. Cognitive dissonance can cause anxiety and lead to crises of faith.

As part of its teaching, Deirenism often contrasts two types of beliefs: rational, scientific axioms and irrational, unscientific delusions. Regardless of the negative connotation of the word, Deirenism asserts that delusions are not always harmful and can be benign or may even have positive aspects. In general, Deirenism recommends tolerance of delusions unless an analysis of the potential benefits and costs indicates that challenging a delusion will be worthwhile.

The goal of Deirenism is to unite religious and irreligious people towards the common goal of securing a bright future for humanity.

Adherents of Deirenism can choose to practice other religions, avoid religious practice entirely, or combine practices from different religions into eclectic mixes or syncretic fusions. Religious practice in Deirenism is like a potluck gathering at which attendees can try a little bit of every dish, focus solely on their favorites, or choose to fast, but should be mindful of dietary preferences or restrictions. In this analogy, salad is eclectic, fondue is syncretic, and brumotactillophobia is religious purism.

The religions that are most similar to Deirenism are Unitarian Universalism and Quakerism. The main similarity is openness to humanist between Deirenism and other religions is its calendar and time system. Deirenic dates and times can be combined into a single number: the days since the start of the year.

 it asserts has its own will use the At the beginning of the year in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists celebrate mathematics during a series of holidays that each focus on a mathematical constant. The most important mathematical constants in Deirenism are the golden ratio and tau.

Golden Ratio Day occurs on Day 1, the day after the New Year Day, in the Deirenic calendar. To celebrate the golden ratio, Deirenists fly kites, throw darts, and draw mandalas composed of golden triangles, golden gnomons, golden spirals, golden rectangles, and other golden shapes. The peak of the golden ratio celebrations is Time 618, the moment when 1.618 days have passed since the start of Day 0 (March 1 in the Gregorian calendar). Similarly, Tau Day occurs on Day 6 and peaks at Time283. To celebrate representation of tau, such as circles, cycles, and rotations, Deirenists play sports like ultimate frisbee, form circles while holding hands, and spin around in circles.

The holidays that encourages the celebration of any religious and secular On the eve of Day 0 in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists celebrate the New Year. On the mornings of Day 6 in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists who wake up early enough can watch the day of the year become tau as part of the Tau Day holiday. It is also possible to celebrate Pi Day on Day 3, but it may be difficult to wake up early enough to see clocks show the day of the year become pi.

Midday on Day 182 in common years and midnight on the eve of Day 183 in leap years, Deirenists have Dyad Day to celebrate the moment when the positive and negative day of the year have the same absolute value.
