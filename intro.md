Introduction to Deirenism

Deirenism is a rationalistic natural religion based on reason and science rather than revelation and supernaturalism. By embracing humanism and religious pluralism, Deirenism seeks to unite religious and irreligious people of different backgrounds towards the common goal of securing a bright future for humanity. The widespread cooperation between diverse groups of people envisioned by Deirenism requires mutual respect and acceptance but also mutual protection from harm. Based on the understanding that the definition of harm can depend on cultural, religious, and secular context, Deirenism espouses both freedom of religion and freedom from religion.

Although Deirenism supports the right of every person to believe whatever they wish, it discourages irrational, unempirical, unscientific, or untrue beliefs that it calls delusions. Despite the negative connotation of the word, Deirenism asserts that delusions are not always harmful and can be benign or may even have positive aspects. Drawing from _The Republic_, the most prominent work of Plato, Deirenism uses the term "noble lies" to describe statements that maintain beneficial delusions. If challenging a delusion is likely to do more harm than good, Deirenism considers tolerance of delusions and even "noble lies" to be fully justified.

In cases when disputing a delusion may be warranted, Deirenism advises against criticizing delusional people for their beliefs and instead recommends demonstrating empathy and offering axioms as alternatives to delusions. Axioms are beliefs that either are accepted as true by consensus or serve as the premise or basis for further discussion or reasoning. As opposed to delusions, axioms can be interpreted literally without contradicting common sense, empirical observations, scientific knowledge, or historical facts. One of the purported benefits of axioms touted by Deirenism is stress relief via the mitigation of cognitive dissonance caused by delusions.

The replacement of delusions with axioms does not require a change in identity, religious or otherwise, because axioms can exist independently of each other and outside of Deirenism. The independence of axioms facilitates eclecticism, the combination of unaltered elements from different sources. Even though mixing axioms and delusions may result in contradictions, Deirenism encourages both eclecticism and syncretism, the fusion of elements from different sources. To mitigate cognitive dissonance resulting from contradictions, Deirenism endorses looking for common ground and trying to reconcile contradictory beliefs.

The most important reconciliation technique for reconciling inconsistencies in beliefs is the ability to

Cognitive dissonance can cause anxiety and lead to crises of faith. The Deirenic remedy for cognitive dissonance is the rejection of inconsistent beliefs.

The goal of Deirenism is to unite religious and irreligious people towards the common goal of securing a bright future for humanity.

Adherents of Deirenism can choose to practice other religions, avoid religious practice entirely, or combine practices from different religions into eclectic mixes or syncretic fusions. Religious practice in Deirenism is like a potluck gathering at which attendees can try a little bit of every dish, focus solely on their favorites, or choose to fast, but should be mindful of dietary preferences or restrictions. In this analogy, salad is eclectic, fondue is syncretic, and brumotactillophobia is religious purism.

Other than offending religious purists, the only concerns with combining religions are cognitive overload and limited time. Imagine if you did not speak any language other than English, and you tried to learn to read out loud the untranslated versions of many sacred texts including the Quran, Tao Te Ching, Tanakh, Kojiki, Nihon-gi, Tripitaka, Vedas, and Guru Granth Sahib. Even if you could learn all of the languages required (Arabic, Classical Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, Sanskrit, and Sant Bhasha) in one lifetime, you probably would not have much left over for reading!

The religions that are most similar to Deirenism are Unitarian Universalism and Quakerism. The main similarity is openness to humanist between Deirenism and other religions is its calendar and time system. Deirenic dates and times can be combined into a single number: the days since the start of the year.

 it asserts has its own will use the At the beginning of the year in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists celebrate mathematics during a series of holidays that each focus on a mathematical constant. The most important mathematical constants in Deirenism are the golden ratio and tau.

Golden Ratio Day occurs on Day 1, the day after the New Year Day, in the Deirenic calendar. To celebrate the golden ratio, Deirenists fly kites, throw darts, and draw mandalas composed of golden triangles, golden gnomons, golden spirals, golden rectangles, and other golden shapes. The peak of the golden ratio celebrations is Time 618, the moment when 1.618 days have passed since the start of Day 0 (March 1 in the Gregorian calendar). Similarly, Tau Day occurs on Day 6 and peaks at Time283. To celebrate representation of tau, such as circles, cycles, and rotations, Deirenists play sports like ultimate frisbee, form circles while holding hands, and spin around in circles.

The holidays that encourages the celebration of any religious and secular On the eve of Day 0 in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists celebrate the New Year. On the mornings of Day 6 in the Deirenic calendar, Deirenists who wake up early enough can watch the day of the year become tau as part of the Tau Day holiday. It is also possible to celebrate Pi Day on Day 3, but it may be difficult to wake up early enough to see clocks show the day of the year become pi.

Midday on Day 182 in common years and midnight on the eve of Day 183 in leap years, Deirenists have Dyad Day to celebrate the moment when the positive and negative day of the year have the same absolute value.
