In the beginning, God concentrated everything required to create the universe into a single point called the initial singularity. Omniscient and omnipotent, God had complete knowledge of every possibility and absolute control over all of the variables that could determine what the universe would become. God flawlessly designed the starting conditions and natural laws of the universe to ensure that everything would progress exactly as God intended without the need for any divine intervention.

Every scientific discovery achieved by humanity enriches our understanding of the divine plan and allows us to better appreciate the elegance and grandeur of creation. Along with science, the study of history helps us to see more clearly the course charted for us by God, because the triumphs and tragedies of the past are meant to guide us as we shape our future. Every person must decide for themselves the role they are to play in the divine plan.

The seed that would grow into the universe was indescribably hot and dense, the exact opposite of the cold and empty void surrounding it. According to the laws of nature set by God, this stark separation of everything and nothing could only exist as a transient state at the beginning of the universe. When the heat and pressure of the initial singularity reached their limit, it exploded and thus launched God's divine plan for the universe into motion.

In an immeasurably small amount of time, the earliest elementary particles, quarks and gluons, began to form. After about a centinanoday, the quarks combined into triplets called protons and neutrons held together by gluons. From about a decimilliday to roughly a centiday, the protons and neutrons combined to create the first deuterium, helium, and lithium nuclei. Despite the speed with which subatomic particles formed, it would take several hectokiloyears for the first atoms to appear.

The Milky Way galaxy started to take shape at about 5 gigayears, our solar system formed at roughly 9 gigayears, and life on Earth began at approximately 10 gigayears. The evolution of life is governed by 
the ideal embodiment of God's will, our universe will forever stay on the course that God set at the beginning of time by selecting the primordial composition of the universe and deciding the laws of nature

As the nascent universe expanded and cooled rapidly, protons and neutrons formed from fundamental particles, quarks, electrons, photons, neutrinos

.
From infinite possible universes, God chose our universe because it perfectly adheres to God's divine plan.

   with The  set by God The flawless design of guaranteed that 

imbue your creation with a glorious purpose that can be achieved at the cost of the smallest possible amount of suffering. 
Rather than directly orchestrate the universe self-sufficient, God set the natural laws that govern all of creation,

Roughly 1.5 meters in diameter,
In this early phase, known as the "cosmic hot soup," the universe was filled with a dense, glowing plasma of quarks, electrons, and other fundamental particles. As it expanded and cooled, quarks combined to form protons and neutrons. By the end of the third minute, these particles began to coalesce into the simplest nuclei, the building blocks of matter.

Thus, the divine orchestration continued, not as a direct intervention but through the natural laws meticulously set by God. The primordial soup, governed by the laws of physics, began to evolve in a manner perfectly aligned with the divine plan. The universe’s expansion allowed for the gradual formation of atoms, stars, galaxies, and all the structures that would eventually support the complex and beautiful tapestry of existence.

God's wisdom was evident in the precise constants and laws that governed the universe's behavior. These laws ensured that as the universe evolved, from the primordial plasma to the formation of stars and galaxies, the conditions necessary for life and the unfolding of the cosmos would be met. In this harmonious interplay between divine intent and natural laws, science reveals the magnificence of creation, showing that the universe's unfolding story is a testament to both the grandeur of God's design and the elegance of natural processes.

In this way, science and religion converge in their narrative: science illuminates the mechanism and progression of the universe’s creation, while religion provides a context of purpose and divine intention. Both perspectives together reveal the profound depth of the universe’s origin, affirming that every discovery about its nature enriches our understanding of the divine plan and the beauty inherent in creation.
